- 👋 Hi, I’m @byvalentine
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development and creating more inclusive spaces on the internet and app stores.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a productivity website for those who struggle with motivation and discipline or learning disabiilities (an inclusive software is a must)
- 📫 DM me on ig, @vkehrwald
